# odin-recipes
This is the first website assignment as part of the Odin Project. It provides the opportunity to show proper folder structure and file naming, as well as the use of Git and GitHub. In addition, pages use standard HTML, including head and body, heading levels, paragraph text, ordered and unordered lists, images with alt text, and links to other pages.

## Reflections
- After completing assignment 2 to add formatting using CSS, I can see both the value and potential complexity in the cascade. There are likely best practices, judgement calls, and standards that are chosen for each project.
